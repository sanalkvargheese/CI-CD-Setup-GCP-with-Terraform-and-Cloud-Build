## Features

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use Terraform to define and provision GCP infrastructure.
- **Automated Builds**: Set up build pipelines with Cloud Build for automated testing, building, and deployment.
- **Integration with GitHub**: Trigger builds automatically on code commits and merges.
- **Scalable and Maintainable**: Easily adjust infrastructure and deployment workflows as your project grows.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed and set up:

- **Google Cloud Platform Account**: Access to create projects, manage services, and obtain service account credentials.
- **Terraform**: Version 0.12 or higher installed locally or configured in a CI/CD environment.
- **Cloud Build**: Enabled and configured in your Google Cloud project.
- **Git**: Version control system to clone and manage this repository.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sanalkvargheese/CI-CD-Setup-GCP-with-Terraform-and-Cloud-Build.git
   cd CI-CD-Setup-GCP-with-Terraform-and-Cloud-Build
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment:**
   - Configure Google Cloud Platform credentials with sufficient permissions.
   - Install Terraform CLI and ensure it's added to your system's PATH.

3. **Deploy Infrastructure:**
   ```sh
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```
   Follow prompts to authenticate with GCP and apply changes to provision infrastructure.

## Usage

### Configuring Cloud Build

1. **Define Build Triggers:**
   - Create `cloudbuild.yaml` in the root directory to specify build steps and triggers.
   - Customize build steps for testing, building, and deploying your application.

2. **Integrate with GitHub:**
   - Configure Cloud Build to trigger builds automatically on pushes or pull requests to your GitHub repository.

### Monitoring and Managing Builds

- View build history, logs, and status updates in the [Cloud Build Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build).
